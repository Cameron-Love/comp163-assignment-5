 Cameron Love - COMP 163, Fall 2025
 ## Description
We were asked: Why did you choose each loop type for each challenge?
My answer is that, in class, we learned that "while" and "for" loops have different functions. You should use a while loop when you don't know how many times you want to loop something. You should use a for loop when you know how many times you want to loop something. I chose my loop for each challenge using that logic.

## Features
 - How my solutions work:
In challenge one, I use a while loop, the given information, break, and modulo to implement the Collatz Conjecture sequence.
In challenge two, I use a for loop, the given information, modulo, and range to make a Prime Number Checker.
In challenge three, mainly use a for loop and a nested for loop to generate a formatted multiplication table showing all products.
